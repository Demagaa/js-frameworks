# Things that could be improved:
1. FW ID could be hidden from client (depends on requirements). That would require to ensure uniqueness of some other fields to keep consistency
2. Version compartment & uniqueness: implement checking if version history is constistent (eg. (1,2,3), where (1,3,2) would not be allowed)   
3. Document code based on practices within the team
4. Combine latestVersion and previousVersion request params into single version
5. Some optimisation & cleaning here and there
